# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
## Problem Statement:
In light of the abundant medical data available and the increasing prominence of Data science,
numerous startups are embracing the challenge of developing predictive indicators for potential
diseases. Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the leading cause of death, claiming
approximately 17.9 lives annually, constituting 31% of all overall deaths. Heart failure, a
common consequence of CVDs, necessitates early detection and management, particularly for
individuals with cardiovascular disease or those at high risk due to factors like hypertension,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing conditions. Leveraging machine learning models can
prove instrumental in automating the detection and management of these conditions,
demonstrating how AI techniques can be employed to address and mitigate health challenges,
ultimately paving the way for tackling the next set of issues.
Aim:
The primary objective is to develop a binary classification model capable of predicting whether a
patient is prone to heart failure. This involves the utilization of multiple numerical and categorical
features, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.
