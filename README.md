# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
## Problem Statement:
In light of the abundant medical data available and the increasing prominence of Data science,
numerous startups are embracing the challenge of developing predictive indicators for potential
diseases. Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the leading cause of death, claiming
approximately 17.9 lives annually, constituting 31% of all overall deaths. Heart failure, a
common consequence of CVDs, necessitates early detection and management, particularly for
individuals with cardiovascular disease or those at high risk due to factors like hypertension,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing conditions. Leveraging machine learning models can
prove instrumental in automating the detection and management of these conditions,
demonstrating how AI techniques can be employed to address and mitigate health challenges,
ultimately paving the way for tackling the next set of issues.
Aim:
The primary objective is to develop a binary classification model capable of predicting whether a
patient is prone to heart failure. This involves the utilization of multiple numerical and categorical
features, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.
Dataset & Code:

## Dataset Attributes:
• Age: Age of patients (Years)
• Sex: Sex of patients (M: Male, F: Female)
• ChestPainType: chest pain types are classified as follows:
• TA: Typical Angina
• ATA: Atypical Angina

• NAP: Non-Anginal Pain
• ASY: Asymptomatic
• RestingBP: resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
• Cholesterol: serum cholesterol (mm/dl)
• FastingBS: fasting blood sugar (mg/dl)
• RestingECG: resting electron cardiogram result:
• Normal: Normal
• ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation
and/or depression ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mv
• LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
• MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved (numeric value between 60 and 202)
• ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina (Y: Yes; N: No)
• Oldpeak: numeric value measured in depression
• ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
• Up: up sloping
• Flat: flat
• Down: down sloping
• HeartDisease: output class
• 1: heart disease
• 0: Normal
